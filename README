The purpose of this project was to create a user interface that mimics the 
native iOS mail application when viewing a message and Safari where
the header and footer views scroll vertically with the body, but not horizontally
and not zoom.  

This effect was achieved by:

1) Finding the UIScrollView inside a UIWebView by using the scrollView property
2) Placing the header and footer controls inside the UIScrollView
3) Tracking the UIScrollView's delegate events and moving the header and
   footer as needed.
   
Compatible with iOS 5.0+
