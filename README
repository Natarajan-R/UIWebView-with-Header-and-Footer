The purpose of this project was to create a user interface that mimics the 
native mail application when viewing a message (and safari on iPhone) where
the header and footer views scroll vertically with the body, but not horizontally
and not zoom.  

This effect was achieved by:

1) Finding the UIScrollView inside a UIWebView
2) Placing the header and footer controls inside the UIScrollView
3) Tracking the UIScrollView's delegate events and moving the header and
   footer as needed.
   
Of course, nothing is simple in this land, so there are lots more details.
Compatible with iOS 3.2+ (iPad) and 4.0+ (iPhone).  This version requirement
is due to the fact that prior to these versions, UIWebView used a private class,
UIScroller, to handle the scrolling and zooming.  In these newer versions, there
is now a UIScrollView, public class :)  No private APIs are being used, however
it does traverse the view hierarchy within the UIWebView.  I have not yet
submitted an app using this technique, but will update this document with results.
